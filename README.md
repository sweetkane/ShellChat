# ShellChat

- Requires port forwarding from the machine's network gateway a local port. This is pretty inconvenient and ultimately disqualifying for a lot of users
  - Possible workarounds:
    - use [jUPnP](https://github.com/jupnp/jupnp) library to add port mapping with UPnP
    - use [portmapper](https://github.com/offbynull/portmapper) library to add port mapping with NAT-PMP
